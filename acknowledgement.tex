\extrachap{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Dr Gareth Jones for his wonderful series on the content presented, along with Drs Ya'acov Peterzil and Jacob Tsimerman, for jointly organizing the course -- and each of whom instructed fascinating courses of their own, building broadly on the material that this document attempts to capture. I would further like to thank the Fields Institute for hosting this graduate course and allowing me a seat to attend (of the figurative type, of course), and finally, I am eminently grateful to Dr Patrick Speissegger as the instructor of record for MATH 712 at McMaster University, and his accommodation and understanding with the preparation of this manuscript. More so for the second part there, if I'm being honest.
