	abstract = {Following their introduction in the early 1980s o-minimal structures were found to provide an elegant and surprisingly efficient generalization of semialgebraic and subanalytic geometry. These notes give a self-contained treatment of the theory of o-minimal structures from a geometric and topological viewpoint, assuming only rudimentary algebra and analysis. The book starts with an introduction and overview of the subject. Later chapters cover the monotonicity theorem, cell decomposition, and the Euler characteristic in the o-minimal setting and show how these notions are easier to handle than in ordinary topology. The remarkable combinatorial property of o-minimal structures, the Vapnik-Chervonenkis property, is also covered. This book should be of interest to model theorists, analytic geometers and topologists.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces and begins the study of a well-behaved class of linearly ordered structures, the O-minimal structures. The definition of this class and the corresponding class of theories, the strongly O-minimal theories, is made in analogy with the notions from stability theory of minimal structures and strongly minimal theories. Theorems 2.1 and 2.3, respectively, provide characterizations of O-minimal ordered groups and rings. Several other simple results are collected in \${\textbackslash}S3\$. The primary tool in the analysis of O-minimal structures is a strong analogue of "forking symmetry," given by Theorem 4.2. This result states that any (parametrically) definable unary function in an O-minimal structure is piecewise either constant or an order-preserving or reversing bijection of intervals. The results that follow include the existence and uniqueness of prime models over sets (Theorem 5.1) and a characterization of all ℵ0-categorical O-minimal structures (Theorem 6.1).},

Some aspects of on (R , + , .) are reviewed and its usage is inquired. The decidability of Th(R , + , .) is a nice result in its own right and quite useful in many theoretical decidability questions but has otherwise not been important in settling open problems. Th(R , + , .·)= theory of real closed fields is useful in proving properties of real closed fields: in certain cases the only known proof consists of first establishing the property for the field of reals by transcendental methods and then invoking elimination of quantifiers for (R , {\textless},0, 1, +, .·). This is called Tarski's Principle.},
