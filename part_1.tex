\section{Part I: \Omy and Necessary Concepts}

\noindent As mentioned, this section is broadly going to be a slow build-up from the very basics (hopefully the reader sees these as such) to the larger, perhaps less obviously useful results that will go on to allow us to prove the \pwt by means of two parts: an \omy-predicated logical result, and a number-theoretic result. To the advanced or acquainted reader, it is broadly laid out at the beginning of each section what will be covered, and so short of notation to look out for; we would be willing forgiveness should you choose to skip them entirely. They are fun, however, so it is not necessarily \emph{recommended}.

Please enjoy (imperative).
