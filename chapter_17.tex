%\chaptermark{Some Introductions}

\abstract*{To wrap up now what may have felt like a very long first section, we state a number of results on \emph{\scds} -- in particular starting with a definition of what makes a \cd smooth in any case. For the beleaguered reader, just champing at the bit for discussion of \pw to start properly: we promise, this is the last bit between you and that carrot that's been dangling in front of you for that past while. For the reader, however, feeling that more detail should be wrung out before moving on, it is with great disappointment that we inform you that you have chosen the wrong text to follow, and that it took this many chapters for you to come to that conclusion. Either way, make room somewhere in your mind for a few more definitions, \lemmas, propositions, and theorems, and we will quickly be on our way to a not \emph{too} involved proof of the theorem it feels we set out to prove so long ago.}
