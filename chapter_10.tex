\abstract*{How one starts with the Taskian ideas introduced in their first course in mathematical logic and ends up studying \omy to the end of proving the \pwr is perhaps and unsurprisingly eminently unclear to any who do not already know the methodology. So we don't become too disenfranchised and uninspired as we work our way through the logical results to the end of a number-theoretic result. We layout a brief map of what is to come and how each part logically follows from its antecedent. This is not perhaps the most interesting course for one interested solely in number theory or simply mathematical logics, but where these two unlikely friends collide to create something wondrous and beautiful.}

\section{And \pw is?}
\noindent Perhaps the best and most prudent question to be asking one's self currently, if for no other reason than determine the worth of their time in reading this whole affair, is what the statement of the \pwt \emph{actually} is?
