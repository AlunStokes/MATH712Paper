\section{Part III: That Which Has Been Neglected}

\noindent It really says it all on the tin; this is a brief, final section where we point out some parts from the lecture not included (importantly, the applications lecture), and wrap everything up.

We point out some points \emph{post}-proof, as we will describe this new era in which we find ourselves, that these notes do \emph{not} discuss, but were included in the lectures. This is simply for the sake of completeness in light of this incompleteness and not to taunt our dear reader with all that they are missing out on. Although if the latter reasoning helps the reader deal with this loss, then they are more than welcome to accept it as the factual and intended inclusion of this section (more of a paragraph or two, really).
