\section{Connectedness: But \emph{Why} Aren't Things (Always) Connected?}
\label{sec:connectedness-defn}

The easy answer is: sometimes we just don't work over connected domains. Take, for example, $(\Q, <)$ -- where we may write $\Q = (- \infty, \sqrt{2}) \cup (\sqrt{2}, \infty)$.

\begin{svgraybox}
  Recall of course that neither interval is open in $\Q$ by non-membership of the irrational endpoints in the domain.
\end{svgraybox}

In particular, we find that a convenient definition of a \defnblycnctd set, $X \in M^n$ is

\begin{definition}[Definable Connectedness]
  Some $X \in M^n$ is \defnblycnctd if $X$ is \emph{not} the union of two disjoint non-empty \defnb open subsets of X.
\end{definition}


\begin{example}
  Open intervals, we claim, are \defnblycnctd. So too are cells -- although this one we reason a bit about. By \CD, we know that \defnb sets have finitely-many \defnblycnctd components which are maximal \defnbly \cnctd subsets, and so by uniformity, it seems that we can always take a cell to not be the union of two disjoint non-empty \defnb open subsets of itself.

\end{example}

We formalize this idea with the following proposition.

\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:dfnblycnctd}
  Support some $X \in M^{m + n}$ is \defnb. Then, there exists some $N \in \Zgeq{1}$ such that if $x \in M^m$. then $X_x$ has \emph{at most} $N$ \defnblycnctd components.
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}
  Given $\mathcal{N}$, a structure elementarily equivalent to $\M$ (satisfies exactly the same first order sentences in our language) for $M$ \om, then $N$ is also \om. In short,
  \begin{align*}
    \M \equiv \mathcal{N} \ \wedge \M \ \mathrm{\om} \implies \mathcal{N} \ \mathrm{\om}.
  \end{align*}
\end{corollary}

\begin{svgraybox}
  For the interested and more informed reader than expected necessarily, it is noted that the property of \emph{minimality} (not \om) is \emph{not} preserved under elementary equivalence as \om is. This is one of the motivations for the idea of \emph{strong}-minimality, but for all intents and purposes here, we pretend there is no notion of a \emph{strong}-\om.
\end{svgraybox}

This corollary will come to be quite important later, so if nothing else from here, keep that fact in the back of the mind as we go forward.

\section{Definable Choice \& Curve Selection}
\noindent In the interest of time, space, audience, and simply relevance, in most cases we will not be providing examples as we have before (as in the case of expansion by the Vitali relation), and instead just assume we take $\M$ an \om expansion of an \emph{ordered} field, $(M, <, +, \cdot, 0, 1)$. Not addressed here, but as a good exercise to the interested reader, attempt to show that this must be necessarily be a real closed field. We will think in abstractness only, and the reader than even tries to think of an example should be rather a bit ashamed of what they've done.

Without any faff, we get right into the point of this section.

\begin{proposition}[Definable Choice]
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Given a \defnb family, $X \subset M^{n+m}$ with $\pi$ the projection map onto the first $n$ coordinates, then there is a \defnb map, $\funcdom{f}{\pi X}{M^n}$ with $\graph{f} \subseteq X$.
    \item Given $E$ a \defnb equivalence relation on a \defnb set, $X \subseteq M^n$, then $E$ has a set of representatives.
  \end{enumerate}

\end{proposition}
